    <h1>Welcome to www.corwindickey.com 2.0!</h1>
    <p>
        With my newly developing web-development skills, I thought it best to build my own website instead of relying on squarespace.
        <br><br>
        This website is currently a work in progress as I transtion everything over to this new site, but in the meantime please enjoy
        looking through the projects I am currently working on or have already deployed.

            Web emulation of the Simon game. This was my first real project that I developed from scratch.
            It was also the first project created for my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course.
