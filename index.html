    <h1>Welcome to www.corwindickey.com 2.0!</h1>
    <p>
        With my newly developing web-development skills, I thought it best to build my own website instead of relying on squarespace.
        <br><br>
        This website is currently a work in progress as I transtion everything over to this new site, but in the meantime please enjoy
        looking through the projects I am currently working on or have already deployed.
    </p>

            Web emulation of the classic game, Simon. This was my first real project done from scratch, 
            and is the first project I completed as part of the General Assembly - Software Engineering Immersive
